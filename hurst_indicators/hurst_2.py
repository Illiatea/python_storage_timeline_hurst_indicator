"""
Please, generate an implementation for the HURST indicator. Python only

Bard:
This code first calculates the mean and variance of the data. Then, it calculates the Hurst exponent as the square root of the ratio of the mean to the variance.

The Hurst exponent is a measure of the long-term memory of a time series. A value of H = 0.5 indicates that the time series is a random walk, while a value of H > 0.5 indicates that the time series has a positive trend, and a value of H < 0.5 indicates that the time series has a negative trend.

To run the code, simply save it as a Python file and then run it from the command line. For example, if you saved the code as hurst.py, you could run it by typing the following command into the command line:

python hurst.py

This will print the Hurst exponent of the data to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
