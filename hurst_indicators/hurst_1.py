"""
To use this function, simply pass your time series data as input. It will return the Hurst Exponent value, 
which is a measure of long-term memory or self-similarity in the data.

Keep in mind that this implementation is just one of the possible ways to calculate the Hurst Exponent and 
may not be suitable for all types of time series data. Additionally, the accuracy and interpretation 
of the Hurst Exponent can vary depending on the context and assumptions of the data.
